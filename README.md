# convert-video-into-music

The Python code above provides a GUI interface to convert video files to MP3 audio format, and also offers a download option for the converted file.

The GUI window displays a "Select Video File" label and a "Browse" button, which allows the user to select a video file to convert. After selecting the file, the file path is displayed in an Entry field.

To start the conversion process, the user clicks the "Convert to MP3" button. The code then checks if a file has been selected, creates a moviepy video object from the input file, and sets the output file path by replacing the video file extension with ".mp3". The code then converts the video to audio and saves the output file. If the conversion is successful, a message box is displayed with a success message.

After the conversion, a message box will ask if you want to download the converted file. If you click "Yes", the file will be downloaded to your computer using the requests library.

Overall, this code provides a simple and user-friendly way to convert video files to MP3 format, and includes a download option for added convenience.
